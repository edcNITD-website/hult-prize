        <b>1. Start:</b> Refresh the page at 7:30pm to start.
        <br> 
        <b>2. Event Timing:</b>
        If a participant joins the quiz late, they will start from the current question in progress and will not be able to attempt earlier questions.
        <br>
        <b>3. Time Limit:</b>
        Each question has 90 seconds. After timeâ€™s up, the correct answer and response stats are shown.
        <br>

        <b>4. Scoring:</b>
        Each question starts at 100 points, reducing over time within the 90-second limit, so faster responses earn higher scores.
        <br>

        <b>5. Leaderboard:</b>
        A live leaderboard updates scores after each question, encouraging real-time competition.
